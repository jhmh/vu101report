[![](./images/vu101header.png "Discovery, Analysis, Writing, Publication, Outreach en Assessment")](https://rawgit.com/ubvu/vu101report/master/Report-vu101.html)

This repository collects all files to compile the report for the analysis of the 101 Innovations for VU University Amsterdam. With this effort we took the opportunity to learn about practicing Open Science; creating transparent and reproducible research, to reuse code to replicate the analysis, and reusing data from another research project.

Main input file is `Report-vu101.Rmd`, output is [`Report-vu101.html`](https://rawgit.com/ubvu/vu101report/master/Report-vu101.html).
